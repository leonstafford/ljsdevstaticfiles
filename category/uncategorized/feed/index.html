<p>AKA – Where have I been the last 4 months?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Wow, where do I start? My last post left off with some late night snacks in office #2 for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701033049/http://zalora.com.ph/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZALORA Philippines</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701033049/http://www.rocket-internet.de/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocket Internet GmbH</a><br />
 venture. Since then, we’ve moved offices again, largely to accommodate<br />
the ~100 developers I hired, along with a massive pool of image<br />
retouchers and content writers, all servicing the Southeast Asian<br />
expansion of the now popular ZALORA brand of online fashion.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Hiring developers for a startup is an exciting, fast paced adventure.<br />
 Hiring 100 developers, system engineers and software quality assurance<br />
staff in a few months, I definitely learned a lot about the local<br />
talent, Philippine’s labor law and industry competitiveness. The latter<br />
of these bore the fruit of a Cease &amp; Desist letter from another<br />
large development center here, along with other companies implementing<br />
lock-down procedures on their staff once they knew a few had jumped ship<br />
 to the infamous Rocket Internet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The quality of developers available in Manila definitely varies, as<br />
it does in any country, but for economic reasons, Manila is one of the<br />
best places to setup a development team. English is spoken here as a<br />
second language (ESL), a foreign language (EFL) as it is in any other<br />
asian countries. The western influence here also means there is less<br />
culture gap between Europeans and Pinoys as there is in say China or<br />
Indonesia. Until recently though, most operations here have been over<br />
exploiting the cheap labor force here and so many of the most talented<br />
developers are either being swept up by higher paying companies in<br />
Japan, Singapore, Australia, USA, etc. Those who can’t or don’t want to<br />
travel often find the great opportunity and higher rates that<br />
onlineĀ&nbsp;freelance work offers (as I’ve always been a big proponent of).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’m very happy with the people who joined us in establishing one of<br />
the biggest development centers in Manila and which should only grow to<br />
serve the ever expanding network of Rocket Internet ventures globally.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once hiring got to a certain point, it was time to really look at<br />
optimizing development processes and balancing the agility of a startup<br />
with the business demands of a company with many investors and<br />
stakeholders. This is where I was definitely out of my comfort zone. I’d<br />
 managed small development teams and virtual products before, but here<br />
we were with 100 developers, 8 products spread across asia, with<br />
hundreds of staff on the ground in each country supporting operations,<br />
liaising with stake holders in Singapore, China and head office in<br />
Germany. Tensions were high with conflicting aims of the micro-managing<br />
waterfall model of software development most familiar to traditional<br />
project managers, while aiming to be a rapid, “agile” startup<br />
development hub. It’s going to be an evolutionary process for quite a<br />
while longer, but it is amazing to see how far things have come from<br />
when the first few developers came on board around 3 months ago.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Other than my career with Rocket Internet, I’ve managed to find a few<br />
 hours recently to reconnect with my contacts in the social<br />
entrepreneurial space here in Manila, doing a preliminary meeting for a<br />
planned startup community which went well and ended as it should with<br />
bbq and beer! Stay tuned for big announcements for the first official<br />
event coming up soon. Startup founder friends and other key people are<br />
already on board, as are a large number of developers, designers and<br />
other talent ready to make a name for the Philippines as an emerging<br />
tech startup scene.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Personally, my kids are back in school, I need to be back in the gym,<br />
 but have found a new stress relief in the form of pistol shooting.<br />
Something I wouldn’t have imagined myself doing, but becoming highly<br />
addicted to it thanks to a friend and his Glock .40 calibre. Time to<br />
revisit my Tagalog lessons which were put on hold when joining the<br />
startup blitz with Rocket Internet 4 months ago.</p>

<p>Starting with one of the pros above, which is being treated to a rack<br />
 of ribs, chips, baked beans, garlic bread and like 7 different sauces<br />
from Racks in Manila. This is in reward for one of the cons – working<br />
late on Sunday night!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’ve always been a workaholic and dealt with short deadline tasks for<br />
 lots of clients before, so the fast-paced chaos at one of the<br />
internet’s most notorious start-up machines is right up my alley. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120711205050/http://leonstafford.com/2012/03/11/pros-and-cons-of-working-with-rocket-internet/#more-683">Continue reading →</a></p>

<p>So you wanna be a web rockstar? </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’m sitting here in my new office in Pasig Co.Lab Xchange, writing up<br />
 my current client-work on the whiteboard… somehow I went from 2 clients<br />
 at start of year to 7 within the last week or two… plus my social<br />
project and own in-house development work needing doing…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I thought to myself now, it would be great to bring someone young,<br />
fresh and full of energy who wants to be baptised by digital fire and<br />
learn the best way possible!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, internship anyone?? </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Must have:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&#8211; laptop<br />
&#8211; energy<br />
&#8211; motivation<br />
&#8211; sense of adventure<br />
&#8211; some knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP<br />
&#8211; oDesk account<br />
&#8211; 4,500 Pesos + travel costs</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The pesos are to cover your rental office space here, which is 4,500<br />
for 1 month. You will be reimbursed this amount via oDesk, earning a<br />
daily rate enough to cover your office rent and travel expenses for the<br />
month (within reasonable amount).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Work hours are from 10am until 8pm, Monday to Friday with me in the<br />
office and then I’ll set you “homework tasks” as required if I feel you<br />
need to study more on something. You will be learning by working, the<br />
best way!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After the first month, if we’re getting along and you are showing<br />
some development, this will likely turn into a fulltime paid position.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I can probably accept up to 3 people simultaneously, so anyone up for adventure, let me know, you can start tomorrow!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>**Cheap food, same as what I eat, will be provided, as is all you can drink coffee..!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>OK, time has come to develop my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701005055/http://leonstafford.com/wordpress-static-html-output-plugin/">WordPress HTML Static Output</a> plugin further with many user requested features and a few of my own in the works.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Until just now though, this blog had been spending a nice relaxing break being hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701005055/http://wordpress.com/">WordPess.com</a>.<br />
 While that allowed me to easily add posts without getting my hands<br />
dirty, it took me too far away from the code I’d invested so much time<br />
to initially develop.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, here it goes, this website has been exported out of<br />
WordPress.com, imported into my development server and now as you read<br />
this is being served in a purely static HTML form.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It will take me a little while to redo a WordPress theme better suited to this lean mean static machine, but bear with me!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Comments are now back to using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120701005055/http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> embedded Javascript widgets and the XML feed may need revamping, too, but c’mon, who really reads RSS feeds?!?</p>

<p>As I’ve switched from my MacBook Air to a used Fujitsu laptop at<br />
1/12th its price, I’ve been trying to squeeze as much performance from<br />
this beast as possible.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The specs:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fujitsu FMV-B8200<br /> Pentium-M &nbsp;1.2Ghz<br /> 512MB RAM<br /> 20GB HDD<br /> 12.1TFT @ 1024×768<br /> 1.19 kgs</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Installed the only DVD I had distro I had on hand, which was Ubuntu Alternative (desktop edition).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For tweaking performance with minimal effort, the main things I’ve<br />
done so far are switch to the Fluxbox window manager. This DRMATICALLY<br />
improves performance, removing basically any lag I was suffering under<br />
Gnome. I’d used Fluxbox or IceWM or another lightweight window manager<br />
in the past when using Linux as my main work machine, the only thing I<br />
really needed to do was remember a few shortcuts and tweak some key<br />
commands.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Set a shortcut key for the menu:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Rather than trying to find an empty space on the desktop to<br />
right-click and bring up the main Fluxbox menu, I set a key binding to<br />
the Winblowz key + F5 to open it no matter what app I happen to be in at<br />
 the time, this saved me a LOT of time instantly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The file for changing key bindings is located at:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:preformatted --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">~<strong>/</strong>.fluxbox<strong>/</strong>keys</pre>
<p><!-- /wp:preformatted --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Just copy and paste some bits, I used:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:preformatted --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"># key to bring up menu: Mod4 F5 :RootMenu</pre>
<p><!-- /wp:preformatted --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The other keyboard shortcut I really needed to know was Alt + F1, which brings up a Terminal window.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Playing music from command line:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using mplayer from the command line to save resources and wanting a<br />
quick way to play a folder’s worth of songs recursively, I found this<br />
command works like a charm:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:preformatted --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong>mplayer</strong> -playlist <strong>&lt;</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>find</strong> "$PWD" -type f<strong>)</strong></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:preformatted --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I find that having easy access to music while working makes everything go smoother!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>**Just be sure to test your output is going only to your headphones,<br />
not speakers when working out in public, I just took out my headphones<br />
to realize everyone had been listening to my playlist the last 30mins,<br />
oops!</p>

<p>Having just sold my MacBook Air yesterday and aiming to inspire<br />
prospective online workers here in the Philippines to keep costs low, I<br />
went looking for a capable laptop for or less than 5,000 PHP.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While somethings are cheap in the Philippines, computers are not one<br />
of them! Compared to Japan’s flooded and thriving used PC market, it is<br />
hard to find such a wide selection here.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I ended up at Gilmore, Manila’s largest computer district (I<br />
believe). Asking around for somewhere I could get a sub-5k laptop, I was<br />
 directed to “MIP Desktop &amp; Laptop Computers Trading”, where an<br />
Angel (that’s her name actually) finally reduced 2,000 PHP from the<br />
price of one laptop for me, knowing I wouldn’t leave there without a 5k<br />
or lower machine!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The laptop acquired is a Fujitsu FMV-B8200 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120703052331/http://www.fmworld.net/biz/fmv/product/hard/blb0504/b8200">http://www.fmworld.net/biz/fmv/product/hard/blb0504/b8200</a>/),<br />
 which basically met my pre-determined minimum requirements of 512MB, 12<br />
 (vs 13) inch screen, well thats basically all I was worried about… It<br />
has Wifi, lots of inputs n outputs, fingerprint scanner and good working<br />
 battery, but those are all extras. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This machine will be more than capable of being my main work machine,<br />
 with Xubuntu alternative ISO downloading now to allow me to install a<br />
stripped down, fast version of Linux.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’ll be posting a bunch of guides on what software to use for various<br />
 development or admin tasks I’ll be doing as an online worker, along<br />
with other tips for working online CHEAPLY.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>No reason not to also do this if you are living in a “developed” country, either!</p>

<p>Yes, back by no particular demand and following up to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160805/http://leonstafford.wordpress.com/2011/12/17/super-beginner-tagalog-filipino-language/">Super beginner Tagalog (Filipino language)</a>, I’m recording here some new words I may have heard or read in a book since then.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>bagong</em> – new</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I first read this in&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160805/http://www.amazon.com/Nobody-Speaks-Perfectly-Tagalog-ebook/dp/B005K8XBCQ">Nobody Speaks Perfectly Tagalog – English [Kindle Edition]</a>,<br />
 and the next day was able to understand a whole sentence including it<br />
in a Western Union poster (something about “This is your new wallet”,<br />
some kinda cash card deal..).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Reinforced last night by my kuya, RDR, when he was the only one to greet me with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Maligayang Bagong Taon!</em> – Happy New Year!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As he was the only one to greet me with that, I’m feeling a bit<br />
lonely here in PI and need to make some local friends after already 3<br />
days here…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>ito</em> – this</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As seen in such phrases as:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>magkano ito?</em> – how much is this?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>ako/ko</em> – I</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’m quite scared of how my brain will deal with the different grammar rules for Filipino, such as when to use <em>ako</em> or <em>ko</em>, but I’m assuming the more I can get actual conversation practice, it will make more sense… that goes for all the <em>ng</em>‘s and <em>mga</em>‘s, too, which I think I can at least pronounce…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>OK, now for some community recommendations from my last post, I’ll take the ones I’ve heard before:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>gatas</em> – milk</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thanks to my Filipina friends in Hong Kong and the fact I only had <em>gatas</em> or Tanduay in my house to drink (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160805/http://leonstafford.wordpress.com/2011/12/27/a-tanduay-christmas/">this post</a> to learn the fate of my Tanduay bottle…)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>hindi</em> – not</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This one was easy to remember from a book, denotes negativity,<br />
reminds me of Bollywood (apologies if I got the ethnicities wrong!)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>bayan</em> – town</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>balik</em> – return</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I had heard this one as <em>balikbayan</em>, I think at Manila<br />
airport, there was a counter for OFW (Overseas Foreign Workers), perhaps<br />
 it was written here..? Can someone tell me if <em>babalik</em> is the shortened version of <em>balikbayan</em>? Anyway, <em>balikbayan</em> seems to be synonymous with OFW’s returning home. If you start to type “<em>balikb</em>…” into Google, it’s auto-complete suggests <em>balikbayan</em> box New York, <em>balikbayan</em> box Honalulu, etc…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>tubig – water</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I haven’t remembered this one yet, but have heard it a few times…<br />
I’ll be careful not to mistake it as English “too big”, especially as a<br />
white guy in asia..</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>kamusta (ka)? – how are you?</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Very easy to remember from the Spanish&nbsp;¿Cómo estás?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>salamat (po)</em> – Thank you</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’ve kind of never used this, I would feel so like a tourist using<br />
this anywhere that people obviously speak English (99% of Manila??) Once<br />
 I have a few more phrases under my belt though, I will be fine to throw<br />
 it out there, hoping to catch a response in Tagalog to get a<br />
conversation started…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>saan?</em> – where?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This one has another hint inside, which is sa, used as a<br />
“particle”(?) for direction, similar to に(ni) in Japanese, or 在(sai/hai)<br />
 in Mandarin/Cantonese. Let’s see the same particle in a sentence that<br />
will introduce another word:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>gusto ko pumunta sa tubig</em> – I want to go to the water</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Maybe not a common phrase, but I wanted to throw water in there and introduce 2 more words:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>gusto</em> – want/like</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>pumunta</em>/<em>punta</em> – go</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is where it gets tricky for me… punta supposedly means direction, but then the verb changes for each tense here:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Saan ang punta mo?</em> &#8211;&nbsp;Where you going?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Saan ka pupunta?</em> &#8211;&nbsp;Where are you going?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Pumunta ka ba kahapon?</em> &#8211;&nbsp;Did you go yesterday?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That’s too much for me to remember the rules just yet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>ano</em>/<em>anong</em> – what?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A Filipina co-worker taught me this one, thanks! I kept hearing her<br />
say it over the phone (work calls, I’m sure!). This also changes<br />
deepening on the following word’s first letter, if it is a vowel or<br />
consonant, I believe.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A lot of those last ones were from a random visitor, who was actually looking for info on my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160805/http://leonstafford.wordpress.com/wordpress-static-html-output-plugin/">WordPress plugin</a>!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To wrap up, a couple of verbs I’ve heard, but don’t know how to<br />
properly conjugate. I’ll pay them a conjugal visit in the future,<br />
perhaps…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>nagluluto</em> – cooking</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>baboy</em> – pork</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I was trying to be clever and typed <em>nagluluto ay baboy</em> into<br />
Google translate, it told me I was this clever: “cooks are breeding”.<br />
Seems “pork” has same connotations in Tagalog as English, hehe!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Actually, I’m out of verbs, just this last phrase:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>anong oras na</em> – what time is it?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The <em>na</em> and maybe <em>ka</em> seem similar to Japanese for making something a question, i.e. <em>xxxxxx ka na</em>?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>OK, a bit of a long post, seems I’ve remembered a few more words in<br />
the last couple of days. Could really use some help with the grammar and<br />
 verbiage next round of comments!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Just landed in Manila today and the woeful internet speed made me<br />
remember my time working in mainland China. In between lashings and<br />
being force-fed propaganda cornflakes for breakfast, it was a daily<br />
struggle to get reliable internet connectivity in our office.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120711205050/http://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a><br />
 is an awesome FreeBSD-based router/firewall/swiss army knife of digital<br />
 bliss which allowed our multiple expensive, crappy aDSL lines to band<br />
together and form one uber-line. At the time, we were using<br />
load-balancing, meaning it would send and receive packets evenly over<br />
each connection (or use a ratio we defined for stronger/weaker lines).<br />
This meant that more users could be surfing porn in the office at the<br />
same time and downloading torrents was like super fast man. There may<br />
have been increased business benefits, too, but really, well-porned<br />
workers are good workers is what I always say (just not out loud in<br />
China or I would get beaten with a stick).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I may setup another pfSense box here in Manila at some point if I could find some old hardware and afford extra aDSL(ow) lines.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I don’t really do such cheeky stuff as download torrents, I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120711205050/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZB">NZBs</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So… trying to get back to my family in Manila before Christmas,<br />
waiting on new passport to arrive in the Australia consulate, Hong Kong.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the meantime, I thought I should get some basics down in Tagalog, of which I know only a few words.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In my defense, I speak, read and write fluent Japanese and can speak a<br />
 little Mandarin. Tagalog, unfortunately, suffers from the same study<br />
difficulties as does Cantonese, in that so many people speak English as a<br />
 first language in Philippines as in Hong Kong.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let’s start out with trying to think of all the few words I’ve<br />
remembered so far in Tagalog over the years of having Filipino friends<br />
and in recently going to PI:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>mahal</em> – love</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I was confident I knew this meant love, as my Filipino buddy had told<br />
 me the important words mahal kita in case I ever dated a Filipina<br />
(secret!), which I believed meant “I love you”, but at least mahal was<br />
love I was sure… I also met a Pinoy in Japan who had named his son Mahal<br />
 and told me again the meaning…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>mahal kita</em> – I love you?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, then I thought this one translated to “I love you” or such, but was a very long time ago I was taught it, so Googled it and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120801160601/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mahal%20kita">urbandictionary.com</a> confirmed it as “I love you”.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cool, two words so far – superstar! Ok, so looking at the above<br />
phrase, knowing mahal is love, what does the kita mean? According to<br />
tagaloglang.com, it means “I to you” (e.g. papaliguan kita – I will give<br />
 you a bath)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anything else I remember in my vast tagalogabulary? Sure:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>magkano</em> – How much? (price)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I had to lookup the spelling on this one, but I remembered the<br />
roundabout pronunciation.. I’d overheard friends saying this a few times<br />
 and asked about it. Stuck in my memory due to this…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>tita</em> – Auntie (endearment)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>OK, again, learnt this one from my Filipino buddy and he had told me<br />
it meant auntie, which knowing what I did of Filipino culture, assumed<br />
anyone female who took care of you, not necessarily blood. Looking<br />
online, seems it is the literal translation of aunt, but also a term of<br />
endearment for an (older than oneself) lady. The magical Google also<br />
showed me the mail/uncle version would be tito, doing that funky o vs a<br />
Spanish thing to word endings..</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>ate</em> – older sister</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I think I may have learnt this one while in Shenhen, China, from our<br />
first pinay DH (domestic helper), but my memory is fuzzy, could have<br />
been later in Hong Kong… In Hong Kong, seeing more Filipinas everyday,<br />
they often refer to their seniors/girlfriends as ate. Now, I have a<br />
nanny for my kids in Manila, whose name is Girlie. We call her “Ate<br />
girlie” to mean big sister</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>kuya</em> – older brother</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This one I remembered from my brief time in Manila so far. Ate Girlie had taught my kids that this is what we call guys. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><em>Pinoy</em> – Filipino</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>OK, so I have some ignorance on this one, but generally knew it meant<br />
 Filipino and was used by Filipinos themselves. So, in Googling, I’m<br />
told there is no “F” in Filipino (which I’m also being told is a<br />
combination of Tagalog, Spanish and English)… So should really call PI<br />
people Pilipino rather than Filipino? It is less formal than Pilipino<br />
and can also swing both ways, with pinoy working the male/female<br />
meanings and pinay exclusively meaning female Pilipina.</p>

<p><em>sige</em> – OK</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I’m not hundred percent on this, but think it means OK/sure. I always<br />
 heard PI people use it on the telephone or in sentences which sounded<br />
like they were saying OK in response to something…</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>gising</em> – awake</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I learnt this one from being treated to a great Pampanga dish called gising gising.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>mabuhay</em> – welcome / long live</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is on a lot of the tourism media when you arrive in the PI. It<br />
seems to be also used as a patriotic cry, but I may be way off there..</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anyway, that’s about all of my limited words learnt in<br />
Pilipino/Tagalog until now and I’ll make an effort to actually learn to<br />
speak like a local as I’ll be spending more time in PI from now and am<br />
looking forward to experiencing the culture more.</p>
